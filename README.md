# Finance-Project
This project's main focus is exploratory data analysis of bank stocks from 2006 to 2016.
Stock information for the following banks was obtained from Yahoo Finance:

- Bank of America
- CitiGroup
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Wells Fargo

I utilized adjusted closing prices to calculate returns as well as technical analysis tools such as interactive candle plot, simple moving averages, and Bollinger Bands to better understand the trends of these stocks throughout the 2008 financial crisis.
